I also had an academic background in electrical engineering and experience in the industry of electric design. During my study at Concordia, I did two internships in two companies. First I worked as a QA at NetGovern and also wrote Shell scripts on Linux dealing with annotation data. Second I joined a development team at Ericsson where I focused on testing Java codes using Junit, Mockito and PowerMock. Having a deep interest in being a lifelong learner, I found that being a good software developer can provide me with great opportunities to learn and apply new technologies. Overall, I am excited to develop Software, solve challenging problems and contribute to a team."
