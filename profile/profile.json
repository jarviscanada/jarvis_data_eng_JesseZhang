  "summary": "I am Yanqi Jesse Zhang, who graduated from Concordia University with a major in Computer Science and two internships in two companies. One is being a QA writing Shell scripts, and the other is being a software developer focusing on testing codes using Junit. Prior to the study at Concordia, I also had an academic background in electrical engineering and experience in the industry of electric design. Having a deep interest in being a lifelong learner, I found that being a good software developer can provide me with great opportunities to learn and apply new technologies, especially to make connections between theory and practice and to contribute to an organization at the same time."
