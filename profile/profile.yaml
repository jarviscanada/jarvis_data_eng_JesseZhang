# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: "I graduated from Concordia University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I also had an academic background in electrical engineering and experience in the industry of electric design. During my study at Concordia, I did two internships in two companies. First I worked as a QA at NetGovern and also wrote Shell scripts on Linux dealing with annotation data. Second I joined a development team at Ericsson where I focused on testing Java codes using Junit, Mockito and PowerMock. Having a deep interest in being a lifelong learner, I found that being a good software developer can provide me with great opportunities to learn and apply new technologies. Overall, I am excited to develop Software, solve challenging problems and contribute to a team."

    description: "Developed to collect the hardware specifications and monitor host resource usages in real-time. Two bash scripts are run and the extracted records are inserted into a PostgreSQL database which is provisioned by Docker. The setup of the database is also automated by running a bash script. SQL queries are implemented to process the records in the database."
