# Jesse Zhang . Jarvis Consulting

I am Yanqi Jesse Zhang, who graduated from Concordia University with a major in Computer Science and two interships in two companies. Prior to the study at Concordia, I also had an academic background in electrical engineering and experience in the industry of electric design. Having a deep interest in being a lifelong learner, I found that being a good software developer can provide me with great opportunities to learn and apply new technologies, especially to make connections between theory and practice and to contribute to an organization at the same time.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JesseZhang](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JesseZhang)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JesseZhang/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed to collect the hardware specifications and monitor host resource usages in real-time. Two bash scripts are run and the extracted records are inserted into a PostgreSQL database which is provisioned by Docker. The setup of the database is also automated by running a bash script. SQL queries are implemented to process the records in the database.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JesseZhang/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - JDBC App: Utilized DAO Pattern to interact with the database to perform CRUD operations based on JDBC.
  - Grep App: Implemented a Java app that mimics Linux grep command. It allows users to search matching strings recursively from files in a given directory, and output matched lines to a specified file. Technologies used: Java 8, slf4j, JUnit 4, lambda expression, docker, IntelliJ.

## Highlighted Projects
**Compiler design** [[GitHub](https://github.com/natsumeqi/COMP442-compiler-design)]: Designed and implemented a compiler for a simple programming language: built a scanner based on given lexical specifications; built a syntactic analyzer for the language specified by the grammar; implemented a semantic analyzer using the visitor pattern; implemented a code generation phase. Technologies: Java, Maven, UNIX, C, Git, dot, Jsoup.

**Secure Library Book Reservation System** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Tianxiang-Concordia/SOEN487Project2)]: Implemented RESTful API for the business function. Technologies: Java, Maven, SQLite, JAR-RS(Jersey), Vue, Git, Postman, Curl, JSON.


## Professional Experiences
